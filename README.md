# Hello 👋🏿

I'm a software engineering student and visual artist operating at the intersection of technology and creativity.  
I explore how emerging technologies can create new forms of artistic expression and how timeless artistic principles can make technology more humane.

My work is a constant experiment blending these elements to build the next generation of digital experiences.  
If you're building what's next, I want to be a part of it.
