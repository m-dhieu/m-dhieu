# The Future of Human-Computer Interaction is Emotional, Intuitive & Visually Rich

I'm a software engineering student and visual artist operating at the intersection of technology and creativity.  
I explore how emerging technologies can create new forms of artistic expression  
and how timeless artistic principles can make technology more humane.

My work is a constant experiment blending these elements to build the next generation of digital experiences.  
If you're building what's next, I want to be a part of it.

### [m-dhieu Codes](https://github.com/m-dhieu?tab=repositories)  
Collection of codes in Python, Shell, JavaScript, etc, with documentation to guide on functionality and use. Open to collaboration (feel free to submit pull requests).

### [HarMonik Visuals](https://harmonikcollective.pixieset.com/harmonikvisuals)  
Collection of photography pieces; a narration of nature's lived experiences. From vibrant sunsets to playful oceans to silent echoes, each hue whispers stories of transformation, resilience, and fleeting moments captured in time. These images invite you to pause, reflect, and reconnect with the subtle rhythms of the earth — the dance of light and shadow, the delicate balance of life, and the profound serenity found in nature's embrace. These are my musings — visual poems that celebrate the beauty, mystery, and emotion woven into the natural world.

### [HarMonik Crafts](https://harmonikcollective.pixieset.com/harmonikcrafts)  
Collection of art pieces — drawings, paintings, and crafts — that embody my perception of the beauty and complexity of the human spirit. Each work is a heartfelt exploration of identity, vulnerability, and resilience, inspired by nature's kaleidoscope and the myriad emotions that shape our shared human experience. These creations invite contemplation and connection, reflecting the subtle interplay between light and shadow, chaos and harmony, fragility and strength. These works are my musings.
